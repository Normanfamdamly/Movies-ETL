# Movies-ETL - Module Challenge 8

Amazing Prime wants us to automate our dataset on a daily base with the new movies and rating. They would like us to add this to the exisiting tables we have created and automate it for them for future use.  We will need to take the existing data and clean it up, them refactor our code to make it simpliar and live so it can grow with teh companies dataset. We will be doing this in Jupyter Notebook, with teh use of Python, Pandas and SQL.
